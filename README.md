The idea for this project was due to the lack of entertainment for children besides cellular devices.
The Apparitionator-inator will detect the temperature using a thermistor. As the temperature decreases, the more lights will turn on. This will happen alongside the passive buzzerâ€™s volume and pitch increasing as well. When the Ghostinator-inator is plugged in, the micro servo will sweep continuously the whole time.
When the light reaches the fourth level, which is the red LED, the laser sensor attached to the micro servo will activate.

This project was developed in accordance with the Summer Internship Prep Program (2024) and was a partner effort with Harrison Trinh.
